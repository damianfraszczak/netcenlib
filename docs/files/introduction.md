# NetCenLib

NetCenLib (Network centrality library) is a tool to compute a wide range of centrality measures for a given network. The
library is designed to work with Python Networkx library.

## Overview

The goal of NetCenLib is to offer a comprehensive repository for implementing a broad spectrum of centrality measures. Each
year, new measures are introduced through scientific papers, often with only pseudo-code descriptions, making it
difficult for researchers to evaluate and compare them with existing methods. While implementations of well-known
centrality measures exist, recent innovations are frequently absent. NetCenLib strives to bridge this gap. It references the
renowned CentiServer portal for well-known centrality measures and their originating papers, aiming to encompass all
these measures in the future.
